# dewDrop: A Social Truth Protocol

## What is this specifically?
This repo contains a chrome extension you can install in order to start using dewDrop
Dewdrop is a social truth network built on top of all the existing social networks. We can
use this to answer questions such as:  
"who should I ask my programming question to?"  
"who should I ask about what DSLR camera I should buy"  
"who is the best laywer within 1 degree of separation of my friends?"  
"who can I trust to move a briefcase of $1000?"  

It may seem like a silly idea but each network has implemented this feature on their own.
Including: LinkedIn, Couchsurfer, Twitter, Yelp, Rotten Tomatoes, etcetcetc. There is just nothing useful you can do with 
those networks and they are siloed to their own product.
